# CursedList

CursedList is a single page to-do list application inspired by Ursula from the Little Mermaid, built as a 24-hour hackathon project during a 14-week intensive Full Stack Coding Bootcamp by Academia de Código. The topic of the hackathon was Disney villains.

## Technologies

CursedList was built using the following technologies:

- Database: postgreSQL
- Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Maven, RESTful API
- Frontend: JavaScript (ES6 syntax: Async/Await, Fetch, Promises, etc.), Bootstrap, RequireJS, CSS

Hosting is provided by Render, but please note that the server may take a while to respond for the first request due to "sleeping" in the free tier.

## Screenshots

You can find two screenshots of the main screen and list of tasks in the following locations:
